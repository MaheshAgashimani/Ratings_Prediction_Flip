,"I bought this on a chance that my baby would be soothed by the sound of it as I heard it on an online video. It is very affordable for the quality. It consists of a wooden cylinder on a handle. Separate chains of beads are placed on a base of metal. It is not too heavy for a 10 month old to lift, though not to make the sound come. It can produce a few types of sounds - similar ones but of separate pitch etc. Unique kind of instrument. Good buy."
,I bought a C flute for 499/-. The flute was not in proper tune. The bamboo quality also poor. Now I feel the flute is overpriced. Moreover the item is non refundable.
,Recieved in broken condition and quality of the product is inferior
,"1 स्टार भी नही देना चाहता था लेकिन उससे कम का ऑप्शन नही था, मेरी फ्लूट टेढ़ी निकली है, क्वालिटी का ध्यान दीजिए plz"
,
,I don't like this
,The product is NOT UP to the mark.
,"Bestest flute ever bamboo quality good sound really good
Just love it buy only this flute not other guru ji"
,"Full Value for money
Best quality flute every
Go not think just order you gonna love it
Sound really very melody."
,"Thanks you so much amzon
U make my day love it 💕☺️😘
Full value for money
Melody sound
And attractive looks"
,"Good seller, quickly solved the replacement and worth of money"
,"Good sound, the rope little quaky, need to adjust again. Good product."
,"The seller was very prompt to respond and deliver the replacement as I raised a concern on the first delivered item. The product is really big in size and made with some sort of leather/ animal skin and definitely not made of plastic. Go for it and you won't be disappointed, totally recommended 👍🏽"
,"Leather membrane and wooden body, for its price we cannot get material also."
,"It's not work as i expected.
before and after replace sound is same. a little size of it which buy from the haridwar thousand time's better in sound and in other thing's"
,"Really great product in this price, would love to order again."
,Not a very good product
,I play it while doing shiv harathi
,Umm....! Nothing bad about the product. Don't pluck out the cork inside the flute.🙄. The quality is quite nice. I loved the design of this flute. I'm a beginner nd I njoy to play this flute of Radhe flutes.👍🏼😊😉. Also they provide tutorial videoz alzo. Contact the number which they give with flute. So u can go with this flute.
,It's very good in quality
,Under your budget the product is great but not that effective as per my opinion.
,"Firstly I want to say that this is totally worth it. For beginners, you can go for it without fail. Soo good experience with the tone and especially for right handed person, you can easily learn, how to blow flute coz that is the most hardest part. Also this design wise is also perfect. I totally recommend this for all music lovers."

,"Went with brand name of Hovner, but the quality which was there earlier (when the owner was alive) is missing. I had to adjust the bridge of the new guitar to get the proper sound. Not totally satisfied with the quality. Okay for beginners."
,The colour finish is really good.... sound is amazing 👌👌👌 comes with extra strings ... So for beginners it's nice you can go for it
," If you are a beginner dont buy this guitar, this guitar is good, it has average sound and good looks but as a beginner i found it very difficult to hold the guitar and play chords. Its a big guitar and only people who are big will find this guitar easy to handle, as i am 5.1 🦶🏼 i found it difficult to hold it and play the chords."
,Best one.....
,Good sound quality
, 👌👌 nice
,"The sound quality is good, but packaging is not good enought... Because of that some crack is there on shipping"
,"It works well

Sound is good

But im not a good player just started to learn"
,"Only piano found with this box adaptor or other accessories not available.
Overall good product for beginners to buy."
,Good for beginners.
,Adapter missing
,Value for money product go for it
,But adapter when you are buying it
,"Good original casio product.
One of the starting model but still good for beginers and kids.
Make sure to purchase adapter. As you dont get with piano
Options are good for the price"
,Good
,Good product
, Great keyboard. Looks sturdy. Have made a little video so you can take a better look at sizing and features. Enjoy.
,2歳児に買いました。商品自体はレビュー通りでいいと思います。ピアノの音もきれいです。しかしこの商品には電池もアダプターも同封されていません。アルカリ電池6本必要で、5時間しかもたないそうです。充電池はパワーが足りないので使用不可とのことです。うちに在庫してたアルカリ電池がなくなりました。アダプターを注文しようとしてカゴに入れたままにしてたら、翌日600円値上がりして2000円になってました。本体が2700円なのにアダプターが2000円ってあり得なくないですか。アダプターが別売りでこんなに高いとわかってたら買ってなかったです。前もカゴに入れたままにしてたら翌朝値上げされたことがあります。モニターするしくみがあるんでしょうね、腹立たしいですかアマゾンをよく利用してます。商品自体には星5つあげたいですが、アダプターが必要なことがわかりにくいのと、アダプターの値段が高すぎるので星2つにしました。

,"Sarà pure una Casio e posso anche dire che non è fatta male, ma dovendola acquistare per uso scolastico, poiché è la sola ""trasportabile"" che ho trovato per uno studente delle scuole medie, senza imbattermi in prodotti che sono solo dei giocattoli, non posso non sottolineare che costa uno sproposito: pagata 55 euro quando la versione SA-77, di altro livello, si trova, sempre su Amazon, a 56-57 euro, peccato che le dimensioni non la rendano più così semplice da trasportare.

Alla fine è un prodotto costoso che verrà presto abbandonato, sia da chi non sarà più interessato alla musica, sia da chi sarà molto interessato e vorrà/dovrà passare a prodotti ben più complessi e costosi: una spesa quasi inutile.

Giusto per la cronaca: la cosa utile è che funziona sia a batterie (6 stilo AA, non fornite), sia con trasformatore di rete (non fornito), ha la presa cuffie da 3.5 mm, è facile da usare (c'è anche il manuale in italiano) ed il volume è decoroso (ma sbilanciato su toni alti).
La cosa peggiore sono i tasti, com'era ovvio, sono piccoli e leggerissimi, potevano togliere le funzioni inutili, come le musiche registrate e i mille strumenti assurdi e spendere qualcosa in più per tasti decorosi."
,
,"I purchased this for my three year old as he’s showing an interest in the grown-up piano. I hate this thing. It is packed with annoying prerecorded tunes and of course playing them is the only thing my kids want to do - they never touch the keys despite liking the real piano. Also, useless for learners as middle C is not in the middle, so if you actually do try to play anything in the key of C - which is best for beginners - you either end up off the top of the keyboard, or if you transpose downward an octave you end up off the bottom. Finally, there is no midi outlet so I can’t hook it up to the learning app I want to use with the kids."
,"I have purchased this for my 2.5 years old who recently shown a lot of interest in his bag of basic musical instruments.
It's a great little keyboard, keys work very well, it has a few drum buttons too and the pre-recorded songs are what one can expect on a Casio. Sound is good enough and there are enough different tones and synth instruments for anyone to be entertained. It is very easy to use (within 20 minutes he knew how to use most buttons) and it's very user friendly. He's played with it every day, doing crazy things like wacking both hands randomly making noise, but also using each single key in order, self correcting.
Please note that you must buy a cable to connect to the mains, it's another £10 more or less, there are many models on Amazon, otherwise it takes batteries, but I don't know how long those would last. It's ideal to take away with you, very light. All in all a great introduction to a piano for a toddler, especially if you don't have space for a real piano and you're not a musician (I'm not but can read music)"
,We need this type of trusted product from Amazon thnx
,The lock was just for namesake.It was broken in a day only.Also the finishing is Not so good. Scratches were also seen on the wooden part of Harmonium.Overall it's good.It was well packed as well.Was worried about delivery as it was delicate but it was packed nicely with thermocols and all.
,"Intended use: Music practice, bhajan"
,Soung quality very nice
,"Packaging for a 8k harmonium was useless. There was no bubble wrap hence there were scratches on it. Sound is pretty good, holds air well. Finish is of a 3k harmonium though as there were multiple screws missing, and making flaws in the body. The lock of the harmonium does not work hence the cover is useless. Also, I did not receive the cover with the harmonium which they should have sent as a common courtesy with the instrument.
Go for a cheaper one or buy local, as I'm unsatisfied with the finish for 8k."
,Some parts are made by low quality wood and already broken. Keys also like made in very cheap materials. Some nuts are missing. I guess THESE ARE NOT DAMAGED DURING DELIVERY. Sound quality and tuning is good.
,Comparatively cheap material has been used for making.. We can feel that cheap quality while playing..voice quality is good and its tuned.. But those plastic buttons and cheap quality material as well as some minute scratches on buttons and harmonium makes me bit disappointed .. Bit rust is there on one iron part.. My humble opinion dont buy this product.. Or i will say online musical instrument option is worst.. I was not having any budget option offline so i chose one...but this is my first and last online instrument.. Look wise this is beautiful product but...... Dont go for it
,Good product
,Nice product❤
,"They aren't exactly neutrally balanced. These are okay for monitoring of hobby/amateur projects, but definitely not meant for professional work. I also feel that has a lot to do with the small build. But then, they're just 50 W, so I cannot be expecting a lot, too. Not recommended if you listen to a lot of extreme music. They do not handle distortion too well. A sub-woofer is definitely needed for a good experience. I'd still recommend them if you don't have a big budget."

,"This is the 2nd time iam buying mackie moniters.
One of the best at this price.
Excellent sound clarity for music production .
Amazon best on time and safe delivery"
,"So nice product and suitable price range
So nice quality worth of money 👍👍👍"
,Great output and nice clarity in mid range. However very bass heavy and no bass control on speaker is a bad design. U have to keep changing ur equaliser at the source device
,I have face some issues in monitoring volume control
,"Good 👌 product
Yah audio monitor ek samay me sirf ekhi bajata hai dono speeker nahi,
(ek sath dono speeker nahi bajta hai)
Left ya right donon mein se kisi ek Ko hi bajaya ja sakta hai one time mein"
,"Prese per un home studio.
Suonare bene, suonano bene. Sono anche molto più potenti di quello che si potrebbe pensare.
Hanno anche tre diverse entrate (jack stereo 3,5"", Doppio Jack mono da 6,3"", RCA), possono essere posizionate con la cassa attiva a destra o a sinistra (particolare non di poco conto). Sono pure belle da vedere.
Però ci sono due difetti:

1- Il cavo di collegamento tra le due casse (un classico bipolare rosso e nero) è imbarazzantemente corto
2- Per essere una cassa monitor è tutto fuor che neutra, avendo dei bassi da discoteca che quindi falsano il risultato in fase di mixing e mastering.

Ergo buone per sentire musica, meno per lo scopo per le quali sono state create"
,
,"I am not an audiophile, but do appreciate all types of music. I occasionally DJ very small (10-15 people) house parties, and thought they would be an excellent fit for that use case.

However, the one annoying as hell problem that I could not get over is the static feedback at lower volumes. It drones and is noticeable enough to stop me from using these speakers every day. I spent a substantial amount of time validating that the feedback wasn't my fault with the connections and installation (kept away from all other wires, flipped shielded cables, etc)...it turned out that they just produce more ""static"" than I am used to.

This is not to say that they were poorly built. As a matter of fact, I was impressed with the casing, size, etc. Felt like it was worth the money, but simply not for me and every day usage. I am open to buying products from Mackie again."
,"I got mine on time in perfect condition. I am using the CR X 5"" for studio monitors . They replace Bose speakers which have a bass boost to them.
if you are needing monitors that give you the sound, the actual sound these are excellent choice.
they come with all you need, including some foam if you are going to place them directly on your desk/shelf. They are ported in the back and one being passive make it easy to set up where you want them. I would recommend if anyone were to ask !"
,"In the process of troubleshooting, but I received these yesterday, hooked them up to my audio interface (Focusrite Scarlett 2i4) and so far I've not been able to get the passive speaker to make any sound.

Tried running two 1/4"" TRS cables from the balanced output of my interface to the 1/4"" L and R active speaker ins, tried the included RCA to TRS cable from the RCA outs of my interface to the active speaker's stereo in, and tried running the included TRS cable from the headphone out of my interface (which definitely works) to the active speaker's stereo in. Also tried replacing the speaker wire that connects the two speakers.

Looking like an RMA is likely.

Build quality seems good, otherwise. Solid, attractive speakers. The active speaker sounds just fine. You'd really expect them to just work out of the box, though."
,"Only been running these 'monitors' for a day but I recommend them for anyone looking for computer speakers.

I have been running multiple speakers over the years and these are the first ones I can not complain about. If I were to compare them to head phones the sound quality out of these speakers matches if not out performs my Sennheiser 599 se's. After running them through my motherboard I haven't even ran them at more the 20 percent and i am still getting enough sound to feel it in my chest, without distortion."
,"It was great , it was really great"
,"A mic that does its job, but the noise cancellation is a severe problem with this mic as it picks all kinds of background noise. you will have to use software such as Audacity or obs recording noise cancellation techniques for live noise cancellation.

I would recommend a mic which would have an adjustable gain knob. This mic dont have one"
,Nice but overpriced
,Average product
,"I bought the Maono AU-404 Condenser Microphone Kit as I needed a professional Microphone Kit to record my Youtube and Video blogs that I publish in my aspiration to be a Influencer. I needed high quality recording equipment but also something that would fit in my budget. I researched quite a bit and was also advised by my cousin abroad as they had also used Maono audio products. I'm thrilled that I shortlisted and purchased this model. I have been using this for around a week now and below are my observations about it.

● The Maono AU-404 condenser Microphone Kit came in a professional box with Foam Block cut-out packed contents, including the Condenser Mike, the adjustable arms stand, the metal shock mount, pop filter, foam mic windscreen, table mounting clamp, USB-B to USB A cable and a detailed descriptive manual. All the required parts to set up the unit.
● Installation took 10 minutes on my workstation. Just followed the instructions in the manual and the diagram on the back of the box and it was really simple. Assemble from the base Clamp on the table upwards and its quite intuitive.
● Once installed the Microphone kit does not move. It is rock steady and the positioning can only be changed after un-screwing the 5 plastic screw tops which hold and adjust the angles of all the joints.
● Another observation that I had was that the microphone and all the parts are heavy and rugged also. This is not just a light weight local equipment put together. All the parts are polished, premium and sufficiently heavy. This translates into quality parts for a relative layperson like me. Very impressive both to use and to look at. My workstation is almost a show-area now.
● The Microphone Kit once assembled is Plug-n-Play. There was no configuring required. The native application on my Mac book pro and my recording software both automatically recognized it as an external microphone and after plugging it into the USB port, I could directly start recording audio on my system. This was the part I was nervous about as I can use the applications and systems but I'm not good with configuring settings and installing drivers etc., but I didn't face any problems in use so am glad I went with this model.
● The internal sound chipset is quite professional and the high resolution sampling rate ensures that the audio quality being recorded is crystal clear and crisp. There are no disturbance, distortion or variance in the recording. The pop filter and the foam mic windscreen ensures that no hissing sound or wind noise from the mouth get recorded during voice-overs or even while singing. My kids tried singing karaoke on it as they were quite excited with it and the results were quite good.

Overall, A very satisfying purchase for me. Looks, installation and usage are off the charts for me. The functionality and quality provided by this product, whether I'm using it for personal Karaoke recordings with my kids to share with family or when I'm recording my You-Tube or video blog,s are of top-notch quality and make this a must have kit, both if you're a professional or hobbyist."
,If you are beginner then go for it
,"Excellent microphone and definitely it will full feel your podcast need. It has been recorded your voice in a very crystal clear manner and also buy doing little bit of post production you will get professional quality wise for your podcast. Don't waste too much of amount to buy very expensive microphone. If you are able to edit your voice by using audio editor apps, then you can brought excellent professional quality wise output by using this mic.

As usual very prompt delivery by Amazon my heartfelt thanks"
,"Best for beginners, also great customer service👍"
,Very good product.
,Top quality with reasonable price 👍
,Good Product.
,"To start with, I had wanted a Daffli, not a Tambourine. In the product photograph shown on the product page, the cymbals were not clearly visible so I thought I was buying a Daffli. Anyway, having bought it, I have no regrets whatsoever. The sound is great. It has the characteristic ethnic charm of analogue Indian folk instruments. And if I don't want the sound of the cymbals (especially while recording), I wrap a cloth (or a hand towel) around the circumference of the instrument to muffle the cymbals. Problem solved!

The instrument has a plastic head, not hide. This means in wet climates like Mumbai and Kolkata, the tuning doesn't get ruined in the damp weather.

One small point of inconvenience - the Daffli does not come with a tuning key for tightening or loosening the nuts that control skin tension. Since this is a cheap but essential accessory, I feel it could have been included in the pack."
,Good product. Size is big . Sounds great. Don't understand about its metal. But it's good for Bhajan Kirtan. Go for it.
,Good at this price. Sound is ok. But go for it. Overall nice
,"it is a good product overall, the metallic sound is perfect, means the metal used in the product is of good quality."
,उत्तम आहे
,Nice tone and comfortable for use
,they have send other manjeera not the ine that is in pictures and it is not gross.sound quality not good. Totally disappointed.Very bad experience
,"Terrible coating that would come off soon. The sound is shrill. And the product doesn't match the image. The finishing is also not impressive. Returned.
Maybe at this price this is what you get and that's fine. But the picture of the product was misleading."
,The product is not at all what it is in the photo. It has hare krishna written on it. And it is painted golden which kills the charm. To the seller: plz put real picture of the product.
,"These are somewhat magnetic, so they are not brass or bell metal. They would probably sound a lot better if they were."
,I am very happy with the product
,The guitar is good for beginners.. Sound is okok.. But the bag is pathetic.. First time I tried to zip it and the zipper broke..
,Clear sound tone and volume
,"Ok, good."
,Pretty decent guitar for beginners... Best for learning and worth every penny
,Awesome
,Very nice👍👍👍👍
,"I like it was fun after 1 week because in starting it hard to understand the cords and string in fingers
It's been a month now it is good so far but the sound is average some of tabs are not so good while playing tabs
But over-all is very good
If possible I would recommend you to save some more money then buy a new Guitar like Yamaha .
Those are one time investment
But if don't know anything about guitar and not sure that you have a inbuilt skill or you need to build it .
Overall it is good for a newbies and
If your have any small brother and sister or any nephew of ages between 15-20 .
I recommend please give them as a birthday gift
And create small Spark so that they can make fire and gain some attention and some confidence and skills can able to add joy in school and college life .
It will a wonderful gift for you small brother and sister or nephew .
Happy birthday to those who are celebrating and
Good life with good personality ,with good vibes
Love you all reading my comment.
Thank you"
,"I haven't received strap, steings and 2 picks"
,My baby very like this products
,High quality. Sound is just amazing. Must bye. Don't think.

,"The sound quality built here is very pooor. The body is built with iron sheet with colour coated, it is very lite when compared to plastic material Kanjara. The round steel layers that make sound are made up of poor steel so they are not making much great sound when used it."
,I like this product.
,"Amazon is showing same product (picutures, brand) with different sellers but product size details are not mention. When I ordered first time from seller SAI MUSICALS, product size is normal and sound quality is good. So re-purchase another to gift someone. But this time seller is SWASTIC SUPER BAND with same price range. This time size is too small & sounds are not good.

So Amazon should listed as different products with size details in website, so that buyers decide as per require size."
,Good without quality
,"Value for money product has a good sound quality plastic quality is also very good ,
Would 100% recommend it ."
,"Like, go ahead in near come your venture."

,Almost Very nice.
,This product is good with low price..
,Good product but price is not good.
,good for beginners but it is quite possible to have an untuned note harmonica and then it will always be a problem to grasp the note in future.
,"Good sound, vibration comes perfectly.... Best gifts for elder kids!!!"
,Good one but small in size
, If you know how to play you can create magic can be use by children aswell as professional.
,"I just bought it as thinking of being a musician but don't use it much.
Still whenever I try to play anything (Yes I learnt a few songs and blues) It plays the best.
And the best thing is its pocket size so you can have it anywhere."
,A gift for beginners middle octive sa re ga ma notes .Good quality learned bela ciao and believe learn
,Value for money..... It's tiny but sound id good..cute gift for my little one
,Perfect for starters to get to know about the instrument and how tho handle it! Also for children!
,Bacche zid kar rhe h to hi mngwao thik h . Vrna muzic to kuch niklega nhi . Tung tung aawaj aayegi . 449 me thik thak h .
,I thought it was a guiter where kids can learn something. But when I recieved it is very small size of toy. After few times check one wire is already loose. Other 3 wire are also after some time all are not tightly tie. I never aspects like a poor quality.
,"The quality of the product is not as expected.
Not worth buying this product..."
,Average quality
,"One of the worst products I have ever bought on Amazon. The build quality and play/sound quality and everything about it is bad. I got carried away by the picture and the fact that it was #1 best seller.

I am not sure how this product can be #1. Returned this immediately."
,Strings are quite weak. Be careful when you give small kids as the strings suddenly snap with just 1 touch and may hurt them.
,A Big NO
,Very bad product
,"Got in time, good product, hand - made which makes it quite enticing, it makes original damru sound, never had one but it should be close to that I guess, I ordered it because it was to be send as a gift 📦 and this is where disappointment steps in, it came to me in just TRANSPARENT PACKING SHEET! this is not what I expect out of Amazon, if ""A Box"" & ""Amazon packet"" needs extra charge then add function for it below item , but don't harass us by handing items just like that! Extremely Poor packaging, nice delivery & nice product. 😊"
,"Looks good,sound is superb. I ordered two, one is superb second one is finishing wise not that much good."
,"The beads and the threads came off within 5 minutes. I mean, quite literally 5 minutes"
,"It was good and well packed and I want which worth.If you look on other products like this,they may look cool but don't gives any real feel of damru"

Giusto per la cronaca: la cosa utile è che funziona sia a batterie (6 stilo AA, non fornite), sia con trasformatore di rete (non fornito), ha la presa cuffie da 3.5 mm, è facile da usare (c'è anche il manuale in italiano) ed il volume è decoroso (ma sbilanciato su toni alti).
La cosa peggiore sono i tasti, com'era ovvio, sono piccoli e leggerissimi, potevano togliere le funzioni inutili, come le musiche registrate e i mille strumenti assurdi e spendere qualcosa in più per tasti decorosi."

,"I purchased this for my three year old as he’s showing an interest in the grown-up piano. I hate this thing. It is packed with annoying prerecorded tunes and of course playing them is the only thing my kids want to do - they never touch the keys despite liking the real piano. Also, useless for learners as middle C is not in the middle, so if you actually do try to play anything in the key of C - which is best for beginners - you either end up off the top of the keyboard, or if you transpose downward an octave you end up off the bottom. Finally, there is no midi outlet so I can’t hook it up to the learning app I want to use with the kids."
,"I have purchased this for my 2.5 years old who recently shown a lot of interest in his bag of basic musical instruments.
It's a great little keyboard, keys work very well, it has a few drum buttons too and the pre-recorded songs are what one can expect on a Casio. Sound is good enough and there are enough different tones and synth instruments for anyone to be entertained. It is very easy to use (within 20 minutes he knew how to use most buttons) and it's very user friendly. He's played with it every day, doing crazy things like wacking both hands randomly making noise, but also using each single key in order, self correcting.
Please note that you must buy a cable to connect to the mains, it's another £10 more or less, there are many models on Amazon, otherwise it takes batteries, but I don't know how long those would last. It's ideal to take away with you, very light. All in all a great introduction to a piano for a toddler, especially if you don't have space for a real piano and you're not a musician (I'm not but can read music)"
,"Its good, but why is there not a cleaning rod part of the kit? Its difficult to clean the longer middle section from inside without it."
,"It is available from rs 420 to rs 500 depending on the seller
A masterpiece of a wind blown music instrument
It will come for a lifetime if not misused
A perfect introduction for young children
The best hand and mind coordinator for school goers whether they learn music or not
Adults die mostly of chronic obstructive pulmonary ailment because we don’t use 80 percent of our lungs. Medical field advise us to respirator

Always an instrument to be personal"
,Excellent
,"You can always trust Yamaha. This turned out to be just as I expected, with nice sound quality. This is the best recorder for children, beginners, intermediate and even professionals! Five stars from me."
,Worth to Buy for Kids
,Great value buy for beginners
,"Pros : built quality is good , tonal quality is good , comfortable to play .

Cons : not yet noticed any.

Overall Satisfied!"
,Good
,"This is an excellent quality recorder for beginners and advanced players for practice. They have very good innotation and are very forgiving of breath pressure and thumb placement on the rear hole, which makes it easy to play and learn on. You can't get better for this price!
For those leaving reviews comparing it to wooden Moeck recorders, perhaps they may like to get this Moeck recorder in Ebony wood, which is also excellent and gets 5***** from me. It's only £493.45 plus £18.99 delivery! Please leave sensible reviews and comparisons!?

,"Classy, ideal first recorder as it looks real. The coloured plastic ones work but don’t encourage children to care for their instrument- this one does. Comes with a fabric bag ."
,A basic recorder that a child or adult can play - beginner or more experienced
,My 8 year old is learning recorders at school and this is fantastic for him. His music teacher has said it’s the right one to learn on.
,We bought this as it’s tbe same model as they use at school. Practice at home and with friends. Sounds ok for a beginner Recorder.
,There are some keys which are not working I agree it's a china product but at least is should work for month the day product got delivered to me its not working properly
,"I wanted to pick up a new hobby and a seemingly small musical instrument that sounded like angel farts was the way to go. I even started learning 'Godfather Theme' with an idea that I can show off in front of my friends, I learnt 2 paragraphs in 3 days. But one fine day I started strumming it and all I could hear was 'Raja ko Rani se pyar ho gaya'. Now it lies somewhere deep in my cupboard and all I have left are 2 sore thumbs and 'Raja ko Rani se' stuck in my head. Nice product."
, Learing for chidren
,I was actually not sure whether to buy a blue Kalimba or a brown one and I am very glad that I chose blue. The make is excellent and the color is fantastic. It’s very melodious and well tuned. The complete kit is good and well made. Thanks to Amazon for timely and safe delivery.
,Love it✨👌
,"Review Description:
Very well tuned Kalimba and the color and finishing is absolutely wonderful. The wood and make quality is very good. Very happy with the purchase and delivered within 2 days. Excellent job Amazon 👍"
,I loved how this sounds and vibrates . Perfect quality and sound ! super happy with this instrument. Mom said you could have bought this instead of piano lol. I love both equally now
,"It is mouth operated. Good for breathing exercises particularly in case of children. Not very convenient to play as you need to regulate your blow and same time finger the keys, made even more difficult by short blowing pipe. So not something you should get in case you want to learn to play music. However my friends 6 year old has kind of allergic asthma. Was given breathing exercises to strengthen lungs which the girl simply refused to do. Hence I gifted her with this Melodica and she simply loves blowing it. So I would say a great aid for making the child do breathing exercises."
,"Not as pro grade. But for beginners it's fab.
Used it in various stages. And it's really amazing."
,Very nice
,"Received one from Havana and pretty decent melodica. Decent tonal quality and most importantly,it's inexpensive. For beginners, it's a good melodica, but the term 'Generic' is little too risky, because you wouldn't know which 'generic' brand you are gonna get. If you are intermediate keyboard/melodica player, then I would recommend to purchase Hohner/D'luca/Swan for that matter."
,It's a nice piece. I'm satisfied with the piece. Sounding good.
,I am being using it for couple of Years and the quality and the sound of the product is quite good and impressible !
,Great product for low price.I received good with a strong carry case.And this an good product for beginners.but the A major key is not working when we playing in low breeth.
,Ok
,"Don't expect to make a career playing it... It's a cute gift, for quiet moments but not a practical instrument. Cool gift for a musician friend"
,I bought this for my son and he loves it. The necklace could have been better.
,"This product can be used as a decor item or as a toy for a child. It's not at all playable, at least the piece I received feels more of a toy than an instrument. Looks beautiful though. Cannot be used to learn Kalimba."
, 7th key is not working properly.. however quality wise product is good. I was expecting a help book to use and maintain the kalimba but got nothing.
,Tough for kids to play on it.
,I Like it
," Cute little instrument that’s easy to learn and travel with..
Amazing to play children’s rhymes and few other songs
One suggestion is a tuning hammer can be provided else it’s difficult to play the songs/adjust the tune if the tines move by mistake"
,"Tiny and compact while the 1st look but it’s no use , don’t expect sound quality , unable to hold , it’s will be use full for kids to make interest on such instrument -but music output strictly don’t expect"
,Easy to learn... Go for CB 50 .. for adjustable snare..
,Its a stress relief box. Awesome.. I liked it.
,"Awesome packaging and what came out of it is superb. I got it in the amazon sale. If you are confused about this, don't be. Just go for it. The quality of bass and overall build will blow you away."
,Not a Dass strings in clapbox
,Amazing cajon easy to learn
,Gud but sound is not good quality
,Awesome...purely professional...m performing at stage
,very good purchase - nice quality and easy instructions
,"Product build quality & finish is awesome also Steel Tongue Drum has great sound.
In the same price range, very few Tongues are available. Beautiful built quality & very good design, must consider to buy for kids. Value for money!!! Worth buying."
,Product quality is too good and Authentic sound so natural everything is really totally loved it right now i am learning this thankyou fya
, The item was found damaged .This damage was extended with the laps of time even it was left packed and untouched.
,Useless
,There's something wrong with the 'A' string. Even after tuning it with mobile app it's does not sound like 'A' string. There's something wrong with that particular string and it annoys me very much.
,"The cover has already torn, please see pictures. The size of the cover is not appropriate. Why do they do such shoddy things!!"
,Its nice and handy
,"To the reviewer who gave a bad review because the thickest string is second : do a little homework before writing reviews! This is a uke, not a guitar. Just google ""reentrant tuning"" and you'll learn that the pitch of the strings on the ukulele don’t go from lowest to highest. This tuning is part of what makes the ukulele have that bright sound. The G string is the G above middle C! If you buy an instrument, you have to learn a little about it. This is much better than a plastic uke for travelling with (my main reason for buying this was to have a travel instrument): the sound's not bad at all, strings are better than other budget buys. Don't expect miracles! But it's not bad at all. Delivery was also very good and prompt. I'll update this once I've used it for a while."
,Good quality in this price
,"I am using a string instrument for the first time. Having to tune it again and again as the strings are new, but nevertheless the sound is amazing! Go for it if you're starting to learn.
And yes, the chords are so easy 😍 I jabe already learnt playing along a song in 2 hours!"
,It's good enough for beginners. Not good for concerts or professional players. It's an inferior product but suitable if you are only starting to learn.
,"It's a good product, pretty much a good sound quality, comes with mentioned accessories but the learning resource like mentioned in the description is not given. When called up on the given no. I got very vague answer from a service rep who was not that helpful. So, i would recommend beginners to go for other better options with learning resources in market."
,Beautiful sound. My daughter loved it.
,I love this product ❣️
,Got all the accessories along with it.
,I would call it a meditating instrument... the sound is soothing and calms you down... an easy instrument to learn.
,This is fun to play and has soothing sound. I'm a beginner and totally enjoy playing this just needs practice to play it properly but it's fun to learn something new and so handy that you can even carry it where ever you want.
," Absolutely in Love with this😍.
So easy to learn and sound is really good.
It took me a while to tune it though but it's worth it."
," Great product easy to learn sound so amazing thanks amicisound and Amazon such a wonderful instrument. So relaxing and enjoyable.

I generally play this after office hours to relieve some stress and it worked"
,"8"" instead of 12"" diameter. Refund not available."
,Good product
,it’s small size 10 inch one .Not at all 12 inch ones
,Good
,Super
,Broken plastic
,"Package is very bad, just send in plastic wrap. Sruthi not matching perfect. Only using the name of Guru ji Hariprasad Chaurasia"
,I m not flute expert. But sounds good
,"Bless with Guru ji Flute

And I wish to have it
But now I have this flute

,"Thanks you so so much to give this flute of Guru ji
Look very very attractive and sound full of melody"
,Nice product and quality is good
,The sound quality is decent. As a starter who bought it to try out this is perfect for me.
,This product is suitable for beginners... Dont expect much
,Quality is not good... no Return policy...
,A useless product at very high price.
,Poor quality
,This is a very interesting piece for young boys and girls in the age group 8-15. They can explore new sounds and explore new areas of music. It is a good piece as a gift for this age group.
,"First of all it is made by havana, not by generic. I am a beginner, and it's nice for me. Sound is loud and rich, better than elementary model of generic. Cover is also excellent. Worth buying in such a low price. But if you are a professional, go for some higher range instrument."
,nice product
,No packing. No screw for batter cover. Looks like cheap product.
," Good product. Kids like this musical toy. Sound is good, very attractive Colour, Middle portion of the toy is some scratches otherwise value for the money."
,Nice product 👍
,Much better options are available in the market in the same price range.
,"A must buy for any kid over 1 year age. The sounds and music will certainly makes them happy. I gifted this to my niece when on her second birthday and even today when she is 6 years old, she still loves having it. This particular product i searched on Amazon and gifted it to my friends daughter for her first birthday, and she loves it too. Only thing is this is breakable else for kids this is a great toy."
,Price effective.. kids play with ease
,Value for money. Sound quality is good.....
,"Liked the product, although quality neither great nor bad, but satisfactory and reasonable for this price. Sound quality is good, baby liked the toy very much."
,"Build Quality - 10/10
Ease of Assembly - 10/10
Fun Element - 10/10

Just go for it....
This is my second purchase from this brand and both the products have top notch quality.
Other brands promise, say, 101 projects but you have to purchase add on parts separately. But this one promises 50+ projects, AND ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED ARE IN THIS BIG BOX ONLY...!!!
There are 4 boxes, 2 sturdy foam sheets with necessary parts, one envelope with all the paper and other pieces and one 80 page manual inside this BIG BOX...
And promise of STEAM projects definitely gets fulfilled...

There are many many items and each and every item is mentioned in its manual.
Also the manual is very easy to understand.

So JUST GO FOR IT...!!!
You won't be disappointed...!!!"
,"This was a gift from me to my 7 year old nephew. He already has 100s of toys already, but this one has stimulated him like no other. The sheer joy of building things (fans, walking bot, motor car, vacuum cleaner etc) which otherwise are given ""ready-made"" is very pleasing to see. I can see him very eager and confident to try out more projects even though the concepts are yet to be covered in school curriculum. Science is no longer a ""subject"", but a tool to create new toys :).
Butterfly Fields also has frequent interactive sessions with the kids and parents to present the projects and encourage kids to try out new ideas which gives the kids a sense of participation and appreciation. This kit is highly recommended especially in the present times where kids do not get any practical sessions in schools/lab. This is definitely a must-have kit for kids who have been limited to only conventional built-in toys to kindle the joy of discovering science by building things themselves, making them more creative, confident and engaged in school curriculum too."
,"Came across this product while browsing Amazon website. Actually bought this on whim. And I was really in for a great surprise. After trying lot of STEM type products (Flintobox-Geniusbox) I was not expecting myself to get surprised. But this turned out to be a really great buy.
Overall the box is well thought of with most of the elements greatly designed and of good quality.
Excellent balance between ease of use and need for creative thinking on the part of child.
All parts seem to be produced after thorough thinking.
Overall super happy and truly a "" tinker "" lab for kids .
Great going guys."
,"1) Product contains all materials required to perform 80+ Fun Activities

2)The durable materials are authentic, safe to use and especially MADE IN INDIA

3) Set comes with a QR Code which when scanned leads us to Instruction Videos which are clear, crisp and easy to understand. It also has a manual where stsp by step instructions on gow to perform the activities are mentioned

4) STEM Instructor facility is provided in case we get stuck anywhere while performing activities which is a very good value added service

5) My Child enjoyed making Walking Robot , Scars Car & Catapult Shooter
This product is much more than just a toy. Overall a nice buy and my child is happy!

6) Thank you amazon for a super quick delivery which reached on time and as a surprise for my child's birthday."
,The top up box mentioned in the video description was missing. That's the only thing why I'm giving it a 3 star. If it had delivered the complete package I would have given it a 5 star. It's a very helpful product to develop scientific temper in kids.
,"Bought this for my daughter and it is totally worth it. Awesome product and the quality of the material is fantastic. My 8-year-old daughter started using it entirely on her own with no help from me. It's pretty exciting to assemble something like this which actually works.

You can make more than 80+ projects. I thoroughly enjoyed doing activities along with my child. They have lot n lots of youtube videos that explain how you can make projects and very easy to follow. This kit develops child’s creativity and imagination and keeps them away from mobile gadgets.

I really thank the Butterfly edu fields team for making such great learning and educational toys for kids."
,"I probably cannot explain the excitement, my son is having. He is spending his entire day towards building it. What a packing! You just need hands and brain , as everything else is included in the package. A must buy for parents who wishes to find excitement. I am planning to buy two more to gift my relatives. I am dumb struck, cannot express it more. If u are here to read my review, ""Don't just add it only in your cart, go ahead and buy without a second thought"""
,Liked everything
,The kit has good intentions but is poorly made and the boxing/kit storage is not very desirable. The magnetic parts are weak and don’t stay together like you would expect considering they do very well in the videos instructions are YouTube only would rather have a book with all the projects in it! They send four large fan blades and one small one the small one is the only one that works on the vacuum which broke as soon as the beaker fell off because the beaker doesn’t stick to the fan motor body as it’s not sized well the car we built kept falling apart again cause the magnets are very weak it says to use 9v which makes it go faster and fall apart immediately so we tried the 3v on gear box and had more success with it staying together we also added a spare magnet in between the parts which helped hold the front wheels to the rest of assembly. Overall I’m not satisfied and think I will be returning it
," Had high hopes for this toy. It looks to be a well-thought-out and fun STEM toy set that has lots of potential to be a great learning experience; however, what is the point if the batter holder (the main power supply) doesn't work? The company was considerate enough to send us a completely new set, but the new set also came with a defective battery holder! QC IS TERRIBLE FOR A $100 TOY. Very disappointed."
,"The products includes several defective components. I returned the item and asked for refund, yet, ended up being charged $40 restocking fee for a product that did not function properly, at first place."
,"I bought this for my boy. He was very excited for when we received.
First one had a bad connection on the battery tray. And we ordered a replacement one as well.
The second one come with broken part.
I really like the concept, please focus more on the product quality control."
,The first kit I received had something wrong with the battery pack or wiring. A replacement was sent and it had the same issue and had additional damaged pieces. My daughter is so disappointed.
,Good quality wood. Very colourful and plant based paint. Helps to make my kid sleep soon. Must buy. Highly recommend.
,Fine. Can buy. Its strong baby wont be able to break it. It plays loud no battery needed. Its not based on sargam by the way musically this product has no sence but ok for baby fun. BUY.
,"The finishing could have made better and rusts protection layer can be applied.
User manual is missing, or how to use or links could have been mentioned.

Sound quality is low."
,Hey I want refund not replacement I don’t feel the product is good at all doesn’t even sound good .
,"Good value for money. Notes are melodious and clean.
Instrument needs to be cleaned of rust and grime before first use."
,I like
,The product is very good and so is the quality.... Thanks Amazon...
,Nice n big but finishing touch not good
,Worst product.
,Very good product suggest to buy good soung good quality
,Good product and value for money
,Good product
,The flutes are not much good but it's perfect for this price range as a branded flute cost around 1500 above if you need a set and your budget is low I prefer you this❤️
,If you can improve the quality and and price then this will be a more useful combo for musicians
,Very worst product delivered in Amazon always damaged goods. Flute is broken.
,Like it
,Best
,good
,"I thought cymbals comes in good size but these are equal to 2 ten rupees coins , very very small , when size is that much small how can we expect a good sound , amazon must think thrice before promoting such products., waste of time and money moreover my great expectations got shattered."
,Good instrument. The brass quality is good and therefore it sounds nice.
,It's is in small size good design
,Little more weight & a kimd of antique looknand color could well enhance the value or acceptance
,"Everything is good. Sound, design and other things. Just one issue is that after wash it shows rust (jang) so don't know it's real brass (pital) or not."
,The sound quality is very basic probably because of sub standard brass used. Don't buy!!
,Very liked by son. He njoys it...
,Drum skin lille damaged skin is poor
,Kids love it and compactible
,Great product. Nice sound. Bought for Church purpose. This is very good. Seller was very good indeed.
,Sir 1 scru is broken so I got so Much difficulty but it is nice i attached it
,I didn't received any type of belt with this product.
,I like all things I get nice quality and product drumstick are super cool and belt is to nice I
,Very poor quality of face: PVC sheet(Received as torn out damaged)
,It is a good product
,Only the problem is that it's both the sticks are very weak. They got damaged immediately as my niece used it.
,Good toy for my little one !
,"I like the product as it's colorful, sturdy and value for money for kids.. very nice for gifting"
,Quality material and Standard tools
,Makes good sound
,My son loves the xylophone
,The product is perfect. Our 10month old enjoys the sound and even tries to play this herself. It is playful for them to strike the device and hear the sound. Happy with the product.
,Very nic for beginners
,Recommend for beginners
,For the beginners it's ok to learn....but needs to change after some time...... Needs to improve sound quality....sound quality has not meet the expectation.
,If you are a beginner for sure it's a good choice for you but if you don`t use it for a few days it smells very foul.
,"I feel it's very good, but thickness is less, more fine tuning is required."
,"This flute is good for beginner and as well for professional
This is better than other brand in same proce segment"
,Excellent quality flute for beginners. One thing I want to add:- If you are using horizontal flute for the first time and after blowing air sound is not coming don't think flute is bad. Just watch YouTube tutorials on how to blow a horizontal flute.
,Ok
,"Tune is not according to the notes. The holes are not in the place they should be, not a value for money, asked for an exchange and got the defective item again."
,Good
,Nice
,"Its been 2weeks since i got my flute. Good quality. I received a bag, a strong pvc pipe to protect flute from damage, a beginner flute."
,Buuh
,"The Flute is good for a beginner but not for professional flutist.
Good Part :
1) The offering price is good , looking at the protective case(Black case+PVC pipe) you get this one.
2)Scale - Flute manages to stay in C# when checked with tuner. Not exactly C#, it almost reached D.

Bad part/Improvement to be made :
1) There are lot of spots on the flutes, which spoils the look.
2) Higher Grade of Bamboo can be used , but I guess thats why Foxit managed to provide flutebat this rate.
3) Flute is bent towards the end, company can work on this tapered end issue.

Overall this can be used for learning purpose, for recording or stage performance one can go for other options on Amazon."

,Not bad
,"Very nice packaging and Gud product for the beginning learnr's 👌
Same color as shown in the pic.
My daughter loved it 👍👏✨"
,I did not know suprano is so small. Because of my long fingers I face difficulty in playing some chords as fret is really small and space between the string also is small. But overall a good product if you are okay with size. Easy to learn and sounds great. Problematic with fat fingers.
,"I'm not very happy without how it sounds.
No aesthetic issues, it's quite pretty actually."
,"Sound quality is very good, smooth finish, easy to learn and good for beginners, the case for it is also of good quality and was packed well without any room for damages"
,"It's a good product, I'm a satisfied customer. Its size makes it transportable and it looks very cute too. The sound is perfect, it just gets detuned quite often. Now I'm not a professional so I don't know if this happens with every ukulele or not."
,Hard and durable
,Bad product don't buy this
,Sound quality was fine but the item was full of small scratches and fingerprints. Looks like used several times. And the carrying case was dull as hell! Then I replaced the product. The new one came with fungus all over it and the lower notes were also buzzy. Luckily i got an option for return.
,Kharab mal supply karne k bad replacement aur return ka koi option nahi hai. Bhool k bhi mat kharidana

,"This Kanjira has a nice folksy sound. You can get some nice bending effects using your fingers. Also, given the small size of the instrument, it has quite an impressive goonj (resonance)."
,"What upset me upon opening the packaging was the ballpen marking on the skin.
The wood was just OK, nothing exceptional, crude finishing, however the sound upon conditioning was reasonably good. Would have given 4 stars if there was no marking on the skin."
,"Product is awesome. Very good quality, polished. Happy with the product."
,"Nice product. Can maintain sound using water,perfect"
,"There is no good finishing and not good in bell fitted

but sound is good 😊"
,It's a very well made Djembe and sounds great from go!
,"If any one is planning to play Djembe this is the best choice and it has a best sound quality.

I am writing this review after the useage of this Djembe
I am absolutely a fresher and I am learning it by using YouTube and this is perfect for learning and it's handly.

The head is too good and I love the bass sound of it
Djembe is tuned well and it's ready to go live or to perform
Pakage was packed well and the bag quality is good.

I strongly recommend this product and this is a review after my personal use."
,Excellent build quality. Nice Sound
,No flaws !! It is a must buy if you're interested. Buy it yourself to feel the goodness of the product.
,"Nice instrument need to take more care on packing.
Rest the product is good, if any help need can I ping you to the number,?"
,"A good product , wanna my son to understand beats...so took sjembe as first step"

,"It's a good product, pretty much a good sound quality, comes with mentioned accessories but the learning resource like mentioned in the description is not given. When called up on the given no. I got very vague answer from a service rep who was not that helpful. So, i would recommend beginners to go for other better options with learning resources in market."

,I love this product ❣️
,Got all the accessories along with it.
,I would call it a meditating instrument... the sound is soothing and calms you down... an easy instrument to learn.
